# MobileComputingFinalApp
This is my final project for mobile computing. We each created our own apps in order to do whatever we desired. It can populate the phone app to call an emergency contact or 911, it can populate the messages app with someone's current GPS location, it gives self defense videos, it gives website resources, and it tells you what to do in certain situations.
